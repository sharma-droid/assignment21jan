I've created a website that displays repositories of a specific user in pure html css and javascript.
- Scripting is done only inside the main index.html page and there is no external js file.
- to open a repository when we click on "click here" a loader will be shown.
- Search bar is added which can be used to search for repositories based on their names.
- pagination is also done at the end.
